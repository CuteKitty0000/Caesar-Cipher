## Description

This Python script implements a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features


- Encryption of messages using a shift value method
- Decryption of messages using the same shift value
- Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- User-friendly command-line interface

## Usage

To encrypt a message, run the script and choose the 'encrypt' option. Enter the message you want to encrypt and provide a shift value (an integer).

To decrypt a message, choose the 'decrypt' option and provide the encrypted message along with the same shift value used for encryption.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
